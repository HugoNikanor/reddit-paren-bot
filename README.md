# Reddit parenthesis bot
A simple reddit bot which adds missing close parenthesis on comments
on reddit. By default set up to only run on /r/programmerhumor

Currently it's kinda broken. That's what happens when you decide to
learn writing reddit bots in the middle of the night, when you have
to get up early the day after.

This currently runns on the following cron job
	*/5 * * * * /home/parenthesis-bot/programmerhumor/cron-task.sh
